# apptracker

I'm developing a simple program in Python to track how much time I spend using Sublime Text Editor, mainly as a way to learn programming, but following a strong preference I have to developing useful code (as opposed to developing a simple game as a learning tool, for example).

In it's first iteration, the code works in the terminal, letting me know when Sublime is open, and for how long. Additionally, it tells me current session length, total number of sessions, and total time spent open. It's effectively just good exercise in proper if/then statements, but I plan on implementing a few more features, including:

- GUI: using tkinter to package the program and display information cleanly
- dictionary / file use: a system of saving daily usage data to a separate file
- functionality that automatically tracks all open apps, and not simply a manually entered one
- compatibility: this is being developed on Microsoft 10, and I do not think it will communicate properly with Linux or Mac systems. I'd like to develop it to the point where it can detect what system it's running on and work seamlessly, regardless of OS.

feedback is appreciated! Thanks for taking a look.
